# The Trivia Project Introduction - Udacity Fullstack of Web Developer

The Trivia App project, originally developed by Udacity, is a key component of the Fullstack Nanodegree program. This project is introduced in Course 2, focusing on API Development and Documentation. The primary objective of undertaking this project is to provide learners with a practical opportunity to apply their skills in structuring and implementing well-formulated API endpoints. These skills are essential, leveraging a deep understanding of HTTP protocols and API development best practices.

Participants are tasked with the development of the API portion of the app within the backend, encompassing both the implementation and testing phases. This development is crucial for ensuring seamless integration with the frontend, aiming to offer end-users a robust and interactive experience.

By engaging in this project, learners are expected to solidify their grasp on API construction, honing their ability to create efficient, scalable, and well-documented APIs. Ultimately, the successful completion of this project will enable the Trivia app users to enjoy a comprehensive and engaging platform for trivia quizzes, reflecting the effective application of acquired API development skills.

At the end, user of the app should be able to

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category, and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include the question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.
